#Gesti√≥nS (ERP or Enterprise Resource Planning System)

In this app, I handled the backend (with PHP), the frontend (React.js), and some corrections or additions to the database. It is currently in version 1.0, and we are continuing to work on it. This is a freelance project designed for a company with over 10 branches, and it is currently expanding.
